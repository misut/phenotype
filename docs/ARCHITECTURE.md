# Architecture

## Overview

phenotype = **platform-agnostic core** (C++23 modules) + **platform backends**.

The core handles widgets, layout, state management, vDOM diff, and draw-command emission. It knows nothing about windows, GPUs, or fonts — those are provided by the backend via a thin host interface.

- **Core modules**: types, state, layout, paint, commands, diag, theme_json
- **Backend contract**: `phenotype_host.h` (5 host functions) + `phenotype.commands` (typed draw commands)
- **Current backends**: WASM+JS (production), macOS native (GLFW shell + CoreText + Metal), Windows native (GLFW shell + DirectWrite + Direct3D 12), Linux stub native backend
- **Planned backends**: platform-specific native renderers/text systems behind the same shell + command-buffer contract

## Rendering pipeline

```
State change (message dispatch)
  │
  ▼
View function builds layout tree (Arena + LayoutNode)
  │
  ▼
vDOM diff v2 — copies layout for unchanged subtrees
  │
  ▼
layout_node() computes positions (skips layout_valid nodes)
  │
  ▼
paint_node() emits draw commands into cmd buffer (65 KB linear memory)
  │
  ▼
flush_if_changed() — FNV-1a hash, skip if identical to previous frame
  │
  ▼
Backend consumes the cmd buffer:
  ├── WASM:   JS shim parseCommands() → WebGPU renderer
  └── Native: phenotype::parse_commands() → platform renderer
```

## Host interface

`src/phenotype_host.h` declares 5 `extern "C"` functions that every backend implements:

| Function | Role |
|---|---|
| `phenotype_flush()` | Signal the renderer to consume the cmd buffer |
| `phenotype_measure_text(font_size, mono, text, len)` | Return pixel width of a text string |
| `phenotype_get_canvas_width()` | Viewport width in pixels |
| `phenotype_get_canvas_height()` | Viewport height in pixels |
| `phenotype_open_url(url, len)` | Open a URL in the browser or OS |

On WASM, a `PHENOTYPE_IMPORT` macro applies `__attribute__((import_module, import_name))` so the JS shim resolves them at link time. On native, the macro is empty and the backend provides implementations as regular C functions.

## Command buffer protocol

The cmd buffer (`phenotype_cmd_buf[65536]`) uses a binary encoding with 8 opcodes:

| Opcode | Name | Payload (after 4-byte opcode) |
|--------|------|------|
| 1 | Clear | u32 color |
| 2 | FillRect | f32 x, y, w, h; u32 color |
| 3 | StrokeRect | f32 x, y, w, h, line_width; u32 color |
| 4 | RoundRect | f32 x, y, w, h, radius; u32 color |
| 5 | DrawText | f32 x, y, font_size; u32 mono, color, len; bytes text (4-byte aligned) |
| 6 | DrawLine | f32 x1, y1, x2, y2, thickness; u32 color |
| 7 | HitRegion | f32 x, y, w, h; u32 callback_id, cursor_type |
| 8 | DrawImage | f32 x, y, w, h; u32 len; bytes url (4-byte aligned) |

All values are little-endian. Colors are packed as `(r << 24) | (g << 16) | (b << 8) | a`.

The `phenotype.commands` module provides a C++ parser (`parse_commands(buf, len)`) that decodes these bytes into typed structs (`ClearCmd`, `FillRectCmd`, etc.) for native backends.

## Native backend structure

The native path is intentionally split into three layers so macOS and Windows work mostly in separate files:

1. **`phenotype.native.shell`** — the shared GLFW shell: window lifecycle, input callbacks, scroll/focus/hover translation, event loop
2. **`phenotype.native.platform`** — capability contracts for `text`, `renderer`, and platform services
3. **Platform implementation modules** — `phenotype.native.macos`, `phenotype.native.windows`, `phenotype.native.stub`

This keeps the framework core pure while pushing side effects into thin adapters.

## Unified debug plane

Debugging follows one shared model across native and WASI targets:

- the common snapshot schema is defined in `phenotype` / `phenotype.diag`
- platform adapters only provide capability overrides and `platform_runtime.details`
- artifact bundles always start from `snapshot.json`, then add optional
  `frame.bmp` and `platform/<platform>-runtime.json`

See [DEBUG_WORKFLOW.md](DEBUG_WORKFLOW.md) for the full contract and the current
macOS / WASI extensions.

### Current native backends

- **macOS**: GLFW shell + CoreText text measurement/atlas + Metal renderer + native `DrawImage` for local files and async remote images
- **Windows**: GLFW shell + DirectWrite text measurement/atlas + Direct3D 12 renderer + IME composition overlay + native `DrawImage` for local files and async remote images
- **Android**: GameActivity-driven shell (`examples/android/`) + Vulkan renderer with three instanced pipelines: a color pipeline (FillRect / StrokeRect / RoundRect / DrawLine / Clear — same `ColorInstance { rect; color; params }` layout and `params.z` draw-type dispatch as the macOS / Windows color pipelines); a text pipeline that samples an R8 atlas rasterised via JNI into `android.graphics.Paint` / `Canvas` / `Bitmap` (UTF-8 → UTF-16 via `cppx::unicode::utf8_to_utf16` before `JNIEnv::NewString`); and an image pipeline that samples a persistent 2048² RGBA8 atlas strip-packed from images decoded via NDK's `AImageDecoder` (PNG / JPEG / WebP / GIF / HEIF). Image URLs resolve through `asset://path` (bundled assets via `AAssetManager`) or absolute filesystem paths (`file://` prefix stripped); `http(s)://` renders a placeholder until Stage 7. GLSL sources live at `src/phenotype.native.android.shaders/{color,text,image}.{vert,frag}` and are precompiled to SPIR-V via `tools/compile_android_shaders.sh` (NDK's bundled `glslc`) into `src/phenotype.native.android.shaders.inl`, which the native module includes directly. Input / debug are stubs (Stage 6+ replace them with AMOTION_EVENT routing). Emits `libphenotype-modules.a` via exon; the example Gradle project packages it into an APK together with `androidx.games:games-activity:3.0.5` and links `libjnigraphics.so` for both `AndroidBitmap_*` zero-copy pixel reads and the `AImageDecoder_*` family.
- **Linux / other desktop**: shared stub backend

### Modularity guarantee

The core remains isolated from platform SDKs. Native implementations only meet two contracts:

1. **Core host capabilities** — measurement, canvas sizing, URL opening, command-buffer flush
2. **`phenotype.commands`** — typed draw commands parsed from the shared buffer

This means Metal, Direct3D, Vulkan, Skia, software raster, or another future renderer can replace a platform backend without rewriting `types`, `state`, `layout`, `paint`, or `diag`.
